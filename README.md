# hounds

*Release the hounds* and smoke test any site. Sanity check after a large refactor, or plug into your CI tool of choice.<br />

The beasts will follow all links (internal or otherwise) and round up any uncaught page errors. As a seamless unit, they will scour the field for their quarry by spanning out, containing an area, and expanding (breadth-first search).

Uses [nightmare](https://github.com/segmentio/nightmare) to fire up an Electron webkit browser (with optional UI).

## Usage

`npm i hounds`

```javascript
const hounds = require('hounds')

const hunt = hounds.release({ url: 'http://localhost:8080' })
    .on('error', console.error)
    .on('end', process.exit)

const quarry = new Writable({
    objectMode: true,
    write: (chunk, enc, next) => {
        console.dir(chunk)
        next()
    }
})

hunt.pipe(quarry)
```

To use the built-in stdout writers, you can use `hounds.writers.error` and `hounds.writers.url`:

```javascript
const hunt = hounds.release({
    url: 'http://localhost:8080',
    logTo: hounds.writers.url()
})

hunt.pipe(hounds.writers.error())
```

To show the Electron UI, with devTools open, and keep both alive, use the following options when releasing the hounds:

```javascript
{
    url: '...',
    keepAlive: true,
    nightmare: {
        show: true, openDevTools: true
    }
}
```

## Options
* `url` base URL to start from
* `keepAlive` don't end the stream or the nightmare session when complete (when combined with `nightmare.show`, allows you to interact with the browser when done).
* `waitAfterLoadedFor` The number of milliseconds to wait after each page is loaded before following the next link in the queue
* `maxFollows` The maximum number of links to follow and track (the default is `Infinity`)
* `timeout` The number of ms before ending the session. When the timeout is reached, the system will end on the next attempt to read from the queue (Note: this has no use when `keepAlive` is `true`). (No default)
* `logTo` An optional writable stream that all URLs attempting to be processed will be written to.
* `urlFilter` An optional predicate function, taking the current `url` as a parameter, and returning `true` or `false` as to whether or not to include it in the hunt. Second argument of `domainFiltered` is a bool stating whether or not the host matches (use it if you'd like to include that check in your filter)
* `before` and `after` callbacks receive nightmare instance and if defined, must return it (see [examples/preAuth.js](https://github.com/justinjmoses/hounds/blob/master/examples/preAuth.js#L14-L26))
* `screnshot` A function that given the current `url`, returns the path string of the PNG to save
* `consoleLevel` A string corresponding to one of the [console logging levels](https://github.com/segmentio/nightmare/tree/3.0.1#onconsole-functiontype--arguments-). The default is `error`. In this way, console events that are not Javascript errors can be reported.
* `nightmare` All [nightmare 3.0.1 options](https://github.com/segmentio/nightmare/tree/3.0.1#nightmareoptions) are supported

## Known Issues
* `screenshot` with outside domains causes nightmare to hang periodically ([ref issue on nightmare](https://github.com/segmentio/nightmare/issues/955))
* `console.errors` not currently handled
* `404`s are not currently handled
* `/index.html` and `/` are not treated as the same URL, and are both processed
* Subdomains (including `www`) are treated as different hosts
* `unpipe()` won't stop the stream from finding results
* links which are hidden in the page are still detected, could use [jQuery's approach](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/2d4f53416e5f74fa98e0c1d66b6f3c285a12f0ce/test/data/jquery-1.9.1.js#L7474) as an optional workaround

## Examples

```bash
npm i hounds
cd node_modules/hounds/examples
npm i
```

Then try out `node .` for a basic example based on the test fixtures

Unleash them on the latest sites from HackerNews via `node hackerNews`

Or use them against a local site with auth (see [examples/preAuth.js](examples/preAuth.jss#L14-L26))
